The purpose of this is to create a twitter clone, that will allow users to post messages to a public stream.

Users must sign up to use the service. 

Users must log in to use chitter.

Users must be able to log out so no one can use their account (password protected).

Users must be able to post messages on chitter, messages an be viewed when not logged in. 

All peeps ('tweets') should be seen in a chronological order. 

So that should be simple..........
